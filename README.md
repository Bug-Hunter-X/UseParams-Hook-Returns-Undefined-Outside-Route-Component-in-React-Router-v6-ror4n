This repository demonstrates a common error in React Router v6 where the useParams hook returns undefined when used outside of a component that is rendered within a route. The bug.js file shows the incorrect implementation, while bugSolution.js presents the corrected approach.  The issue arises from the fact that useParams is context-aware and will only provide correct values within the component hierarchy defined by your routes.  This example illustrates how to solve this by either nesting components correctly or using techniques such as data lifting to pass parameters up the component tree.
